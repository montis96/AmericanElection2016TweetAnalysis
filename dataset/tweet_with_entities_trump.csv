405,Certain RepublicanPartyUnitedStates who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad
406,"""StaySimplyRedalbum on message"" is the Chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!"
407,I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
408,"It is not ""Freedomofthepress of the press"" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!"
409,"I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!"
410,Crooked Hillary HillaryClinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or Politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
411,My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
412,"If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%"
413,"The failing @TheNewYorkTimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said"
414,The failing @TheNewYorkTimes talks about Sourcejournalism and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is Fiction. The media protects Hillary!
